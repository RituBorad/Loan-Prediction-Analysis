### Loan Status Prediction Analysis

- A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non- Performing Assets. It is done by predicting if the loan can be given to that person on the basis of various parameters like credit score, income, age, marital status, gender, etc. The prediction model not only helps the applicant but also helps the bank by minimizing the risk and reducing the number of defaulters.

- A huge dataset(loan.csv) containing data like applicant's personal information, employment status, marital status, credit history etc.

- All the codes are developed in Python and the Python library used is Pandas and Scikit Learn Library.

- Logistic Regression techniques from SKLearn are used to analyse the dataset to predict the applicant's loan status.
